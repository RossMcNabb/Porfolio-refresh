            <img class="profilepic" src="" alt="Profile Picture">
            <p>My name is Ross McNabb, I'm 28 years old and looking for an opertuntiy as a junior developer</p>
            <p> I have worked in the Tech sector based in low/no code CLM platforms for about 5 years and during that time I found when i got the opertunity I loved utilising any coding language I could during my work. So I found out about Manchester Codes and thought it would be a great opertunity to learn more.
